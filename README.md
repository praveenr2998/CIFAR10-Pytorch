# CIFAR10-Pytorch
Model created for recognition of CIFAR10 datapoint using Logistic Regression, FeedForward Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (With and Without GPU)

The notebooks are designed such that the program automatically chooses the GPU if available(CUDA drivers must be preinstalled) or else CPU and trains a neural network.

The models are programmed in #Pytorch

LIBRARIES : os, pytorch-1.5.1(GPU version), tarfile

CIFAR10-Dataset website : http://files.fast.ai/data/cifar10.tgz

Credits : Thanks to the lectures in freecodecamp lectured by Aakash.
